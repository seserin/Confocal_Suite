# Confocal_Suite
This project provides software to operate a confocal microscope using a Thorlabs NanoMax 300 stage with closed-loop piezo positioning over a 20 Âµm FOV. Photoluminescence data is collected via two ID120 silicon APDs from ID Quantique. Ideal for high-resolution assessment of visible wavelength colour centre defects in wide band gap semiconductors.
